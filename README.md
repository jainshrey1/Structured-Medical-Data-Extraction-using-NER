🩺 Structuring Patient Transcripts for Medical Research Using Named Entity Recognition (NER)
🏥 Overview
This project transforms unstructured patient transcript data into a structured format using SQL, enabling deeper medical research analysis. By leveraging a biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) model tailored to the healthcare domain, the system extracts key medical entities. The outcome is a structured dataset that supports efficient research and decision-making. This report outlines the approach, methodology, decisions made, and recommendations for future improvement.

🔬 NER Approach
🧬 Model Choice
We selected a biomedical NER model trained specifically on medical data to ensure accurate extraction of clinically relevant entities, aligning well with the project's research-oriented goals.

📊 Workflow
The process began with dataset collection and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and content. After basic cleaning and preprocessing, the NER model extracted 37 unique medical entities. These were refined based on relevance to stakeholders and research needs.

💉 Entity Selection Strategy
Entity inclusion was guided by their value to ongoing medical research, particularly those related to patient demographics, health conditions, treatments, and diagnostic procedures. Key demographic attributes (age, sex, race) were preserved for every patient record. Clinical details such as diseases, symptoms, severity, medications, procedures, biological structures, and patient history (including family background) were deemed essential for uncovering patterns and insights.

📋 Final Entity Set
The structured dataset includes the following attributes:

user_id	Race	Sex	Age	Medication	Disease_Disorder	Diagnostic_Procedure	Therapeutic_Procedure	Biological_Structure	Severity	Sign_Symptom	Family_History	History

Refer to Medical_NER_DSRH.csv for the complete structured dataset.

💊 SQL Schema Design
To effectively store the extracted data, a SQL schema was designed with flexibility and scalability in mind. Strategies such as nullable fields and normalization were applied to manage data sparsity and complexity while ensuring performance and analytical efficiency.

🔍 Normalization and Schema Design
Due to the multivalued nature of several attributes, the database was normalized:

A central Patient table stores demographic data.

Additional tables for Medications, Diseases, Symptoms, Procedures, Histories, and Biological Structures are linked through patient identifiers.

This separation allows cleaner structure, reduces redundancy, and supports detailed, scalable analysis.

Non-critical entities may be omitted depending on the required level of detail for future studies.

🧪 Technical and Strategic Alignment
This project’s technical implementation directly supports the goals of the medical research institute. The chosen entities enable robust KPI tracking and pattern discovery. The SQL schema is designed for seamless deployment on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS Redshift, Athena), facilitating secure, scalable analytics and integration with visualization tools like AWS QuickSight.

📈 Future Enhancements
Model Evaluation: Continue testing other NER models to ensure best-in-class medical entity extraction.

Entity Growth: Expand the set of extracted entities to support broader research use cases.

Schema Optimization: Refine the SQL schema as new data and requirements emerge.

Strategic Review: Regularly reassess project outputs to ensure alignment with research goals.

Human-in-the-Loop: Integrate expert feedback to improve model accuracy and relevance.

LLM Integration: Explore large language models for intuitive querying and quick insights.

🎯 Conclusion
This project successfully bridges unstructured clinical text and structured data analysis. By applying biomedical NER and thoughtful SQL design, it lays the groundwork for advanced research capabilities, empowering healthcare analysts and researchers with actionable insights from complex patient data.
